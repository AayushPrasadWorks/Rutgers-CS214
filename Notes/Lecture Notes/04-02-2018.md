## Threading Review ## 

A thread is an execution context within a process.  
* different threads may be in different places within a program, have different local variables, stacks, etc., but all share heap and globals.  
* Without threading, you just have one execution context per process.  

A joinable thread maintains its information [such has return value] until join is called.  

A detached thread disappears once it finishes.  

Can be used to keep working while waiting for I/O.  

Monitor - data structure protected by a mutex.  

## Networking ## 

For assignment: 
* design a network protocol 
* write a client library that uses the protocol  
* write a server that supports the protocol  

What is a protocol?  
* in the context of networks, it is messages and procedures for doing things.  
* What can the client say to the server? [requests]  
* How does the server respond?  
  * What is the format of the response?  
  * What actually happens?
