## sizeof ##
```
sizeof(int) // 4
int x;
sizeof(x) // 4

void foo(int n, int array[]){
  sizeof(array) // 8, aka sizeof(int *)
}

int array[5] //declaring a local array variable
sizeof(array) // = 5 * sizeof(int)

int * array = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int) * 5);
sizeof(array) // = sizeof(int *)
```
To note: When declaring the array as a local variable, it returns the total size occupied by the array.  

## Proccesses ##

A process is a program that's running.  
* Program code
* Program state
 * PC
 * Contents of memory

Every process on a UNIX-like system has a process ID [pid].

Can view list of running processes associated with current user using __ps__ command.

__top__: 

__kill__ :  

__Where do processes come from?__
The OS creates a process.  
Two functions that get used:
* __exec__: replace the current process with a new process.  
* __fork__: clone the current process. 
  * Differences between the parent and child processes are:
    * address space
    * pid
    * ppid [parent pid]
  * Similarities:
    * some code
    * some variables and data
    * some file descriptors
    * some signal handlers 
  * Return values from fork:
    * child: 0 
    * parent: child's pid 
  ```
  if(fork() == 0){
    exec(something);
  }
  ```
